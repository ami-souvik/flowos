Designing a home is exciting, but without proper planning, small mistakes can affect comfort, functionality, and long-term maintenance. Kolkata homes, in particular, require thoughtful decisions due to climate, space constraints, and lifestyle needs.

Here are **five common interior design mistakes** homeowners should avoid — and how to get it right.

## 1. Ignoring Ventilation & Natural Light

Poor ventilation can make interiors feel uncomfortable, especially during humid months.

### What to Do Instead
- Allow for cross-ventilation
- Use sheer curtains where possible
- Avoid blocking windows with heavy furniture
- Choose breathable materials

A well-ventilated home feels brighter, healthier, and more comfortable.

## 2. Choosing Style Over Functionality

Beautiful designs are important — but practicality matters just as much.

### Common Issues
- Oversized furniture in small rooms
- Insufficient storage
- Hard-to-maintain materials

Good interior design balances **visual appeal and everyday usability**.

## 3. Not Planning Storage Early

Storage is often treated as an afterthought, which leads to clutter.

### Smart Storage Ideas
- Built-in wardrobes
- Bed storage
- Vertical cabinets
- Multi-functional furniture

Proper storage keeps your home organized and visually clean.

## 4. Poor Lighting Decisions

Using only one light source per room is a common mistake.

### Better Lighting Approach
- Combine ceiling lights with wall lights and lamps
- Use warm lighting for bedrooms and living rooms

Lighting can completely change how a space feels.
