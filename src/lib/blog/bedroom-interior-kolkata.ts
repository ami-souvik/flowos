Bedrooms here often need to accommodate:
- Compact room sizes
- High humidity
- Storage requirements
- Multi-purpose usage

A well-planned design makes the space feel calm and uncluttered.

## 1. Choosing the Right Color Palette

Color has a strong impact on mood.

### Ideal Bedroom Colors
- Soft neutrals like beige, ivory, and grey
- Muted greens and blues for calmness
- Warm wood tones for comfort

Avoid overly dark or glossy finishes that can feel heavy.

## 2. Smart Wardrobe & Storage Planning

Storage should feel seamless, not overwhelming.

### Practical Storage Ideas
- Sliding wardrobes for space-saving

- Internal organizers for daily convenience

Good storage keeps the bedroom visually peaceful.

## 3. Lighting for Rest & Relaxation

Bedrooms need softer, layered lighting.

### Lighting Approach
- Warm ceiling lights
- Bedside wall lamps or pendant lights
- Soft accent lighting for wardrobes or panels

Lighting should help you unwind, not overstimulate.

## 4. Designing Around Comfort

Comfort goes beyond the bed.

### Comfort-Focused Design

- Minimal clutter

A calm environment improves sleep and well-being.
